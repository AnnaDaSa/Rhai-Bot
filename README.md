# Rhai-Bot
Trying to develop a bot for sqlillo.com game. The idea is to score the possible movements of each worker and so move to the highest score. 
When we reach the first strategy to work, we'll begin the second challenge. 
This one consists on applying coworking between the 8 workers or between the subteams made to match the strategy.
